NSDXFRD2
# This file is written on exit by nsd xfr daemon.
# This file contains slave zone information:
# 	* timeouts (when was zone data acquired)
# 	* state (OK, refreshing, expired)
# 	* which master transfer to attempt next
# The file is read on start (but not on reload) by nsd xfr daemon.
# You can edit; but do not change statement order
# and no fancy stuff (like quoted "strings").
#
# If you remove a zone entry, it will be refreshed.
# This can be useful for an expired zone; it revives
# the zone temporarily, from refresh-expiry time.
# If you delete the file all slave zones are updated.
#
# Note: if you edit this file while nsd is running,
#       it will be overwritten on exit by nsd.
